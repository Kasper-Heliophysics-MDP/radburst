# Solar Radio Burst Detection

## Overview

This module focuses on the detection of solar radio bursts from spectrogram data. The detection process is a crucial first step in identifying and classifying these phenomena.

## Key Components

1. **Preprocessing**: Before detection, the spectrogram data typically undergoes preprocessing steps such as noise reduction and normalization. These steps are crucial for improving the detection accuracy.

2. **Detection Algorithm**: The core of this module is the burst detection algorithm. While the specific implementation details are not provided in the current codebase, common approaches include:
   - Drift Rate-based detection
   - Machine learning-based anomaly detection

3. **Post-processing**: After initial detection, post-processing steps may be applied to refine the results, such as merging nearby detections or filtering out false positives.

## Usage

To use the detection module, you typically would:

1. Load the spectrogram data using the utility functions

2. Preprocess the data:

3. Apply the detection algorithm (placeholder as the actual implementation is not provided):

## Future Improvements

- Implement and document specific detection algorithms
- Add performance metrics for evaluating detection accuracy
- Integrate detection results with the classification module
