# Burst Detection Overview

This module focuses on the detection of solar radio bursts from spectrogram data. The detection process is a crucial first step in identifying and classifying these phenomena.

## Key Components

1. **Preprocessing**: Before detection, the spectrogram data typically undergoes preprocessing steps such as noise reduction and normalization. These steps are crucial for improving the detection accuracy.

2. **Detection Algorithm**: The core of this module is the burst detection algorithm. While not all methods are implemented in this codebase, refer to the following pages for more information on each approach:
      - [Drift Rate-Based Detection](detection_drift_rate.md)
      - [Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection](detection_ml.md)
      - [Morphological Operations for Identifying Candidate Regions](detection_morph_ops.md)


3. **Post-processing**: After initial detection, post-processing steps may be applied to refine the results, such as merging nearby detections or filtering out false positives.

## Usage

To use the detection module, you typically would:

1. Load the spectrogram data using the utility functions

2. Preprocess the data:

3. Apply the detection algorithm (placeholder as the actual implementation is not provided):

## Future Improvements

- Implement and document specific detection algorithms
- Add performance metrics for evaluating detection accuracy
- Integrate detection results with the classification module
