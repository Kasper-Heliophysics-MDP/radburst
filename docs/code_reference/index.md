# Overview

This section provides a comprehensive reference for the RadBurst codebase. It covers the main components of the project, including utilities, detection algorithms, and classification models.

## Structure

The RadBurst project is organized into several key modules:

1. **Utilities**: Common functions and tools used throughout the project.
   - [Preprocessing](utils/preprocessing.md): Data preprocessing functions.
   - [General Utilities](utils/utils.md): General-purpose utility functions.

2. **Detection**: Algorithms and methods for detecting solar radio bursts.
   - [Detection Algorithms](detection/detection.md): Overview of burst detection techniques.

3. **Classification**: Models and methods for classifying detected bursts.
   - [Classification Models](classification/classification.md): Details on the CNN-based classification system.

Each subsection provides in-depth documentation on the respective module's functions, classes, and usage examples.
