`create_labels.ipynb` was used to create label files using burst classificaitons from the summer (classification_labels_raw.csv).

Two files were created: 
- `full-labels-20240120-20241009.csv` contains labels* for all samples contained in the Google drive FITfiles (as of 10/18/2024).
- `filtered-labels-20240309-20240701.csv` contains labels for all samples within the range of dates that manual classifications were made. 

*NOTE: The full labels contain more recent data that was not looked at and classified by anyone yet. For samples that were not classified by our team, the label was set to 0 for no-burst. The filtered data was all looked over, manually classified and checked with other ecallisto sources.
